# CS-250-Software-Development

I can interpret user needs and implement them in the form of user stories. User stories are a way to change a user's interview into a form of useful information
about how to proceed in the development of the application the user's interview was about. As a result, creating user stories accelerates the development of programs
in ways a user directly desires. I approach developing programs with the idea that there is always a potential improvement. This method of approach means that I can always 
consider my work never truly done. I hope to apply either the Retrospective or Review part of the agile processes in my future development work as I believe either of these
agile processes are useful in understanding where I was at with the work and how I've changed and improved with my work since then. To me, being a good team member in software 
development is where a person is polite, courteous, punctual, and productive. A polite person is one who any team member can work with, even if the two team members do not like
each other. Courteous makes sure proper respect to everyone, both those who are considered employees and employers of the person in question. Punctual simply makes sure that they 
are on time to the various important events of the workplace. Productive is meant as a quality that suggests the person in question produces work at a consistent speed that is
acceptable to the workplace. These four traits are what I believe any good team member needs to possess as a 'good' team member.
